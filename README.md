# Clone Page of Nike Air Force Shoe - [Live Link](https://nike-clone-lyart-iota.vercel.app/)
Here, I am using Tailwind CSS to style my Webpage. Tailwind CSS is a great framework to style ***efficiently and effectively.***

## About Project
This is a clone Project of nike air force page where i applied Tailwind CSS. This clone is fully responsive but not fully interactive because my main focus was in styling through tailwind css and due to this project I have learned amazing tricks which i am pretty sure will come in handy in future. Some parts are also interactive like scrolling through *outfit section* or *you may like others section*. **You can check more about the website in above link.**
